                <h1 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
                
                
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, 
                 networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
                 These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, 
                 or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; 
                 or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly 
                 challenging today because there are more devices than people, 
                 and attackers are becoming more innovative</p>

                 <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">What is Cybersecurity all About?</h4>


                 <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection 
                spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one 
                intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, 
                and technology must all complement one another to create an effective 
                defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can
                automate integrations across select Cisco Security products and 
                accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation,
                and remediation.</p>

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Cybersecurity Strategies</h4>


                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 1-Creating a Secure Cyber Ecosystem</h4>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">The cyber ecosystem involves a wide range of varied entities like devices
                (communication technologies and computers), individuals, governments,
                private organizations, etc., which interact with each other for numerous 
                reasons.
                </p>

                 <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 2-Creating an Assurance Framework</h4>

                 <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">The objective of this strategy is to design an outline in compliance with the
                 global security standards through traditional products, processes, people, 
                 and technology. To cater to the national security requirements, a national framework known as 
                 the Cybersecurity Assurance Framework was developed.</p>


                 <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 3-Encouraging Open Standards</h4>

                 <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Standards play a significant role in defining how we approach information 
                 security related issues across geographical regions and societies. 
                 Open standards are encouraged to:</p>

                 <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Enhance the efficiency of key processes-
                Enable systems incorporations-
                Provide a medium for users to measure new products or services-
                Organize the approach to arrange new technologies or business models-
                Interpret complex environments and
                Endorse economic growth.</p>

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 4-Strengthening the Regulatory Framework</h4>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">The objective of this strategy is to create a secure cyberspace ecosystem and strengthen the regulatory framework.</p>

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 5-Creating Mechanisms for IT Security</h4>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Some basic mechanisms that are in place for ensuring IT security are − link-oriented security measures, end-to-end security measures, association-oriented measures, and data encryption. 
                These methods differ in their internal application features and also in the attributes 
                of the security they provide.</p>



                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Strategy 6-Securing E-Governance Services</h4>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Electronic governance (e-governance) is the most treasured instrument with the 
                government to provide public services in an accountable manner.</p>

                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Stategy 7-Protecting Critical Condition Information Infastracture</h4>

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">Critical information infrastructure is the backbone of a country’s national and
                economic security. It includes power plants, highways, bridges, chemical 
                plants, networks, as well as the buildings where millions of people work
                every day. These can be secured with stringent collaboration plans and disciplined implementations.
